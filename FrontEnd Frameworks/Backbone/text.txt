Strip the myState object into two arrays, one filled with its keys, the other with its values.

_.keys(myState)

_.values(myState)

Using these two new arrays, put them back together as an object to resemble the original myState object.

var arr = _.zip(one, two);

Alert each of the key - value pairs of the myState object.

_.each(myState, function(value, key){ alert(key+': '+value); });

Return just the names of the businesses from the businesses array.

var businessNames = _.pluck(businesses, 'name');

Return the object containing “Microsoft”.

var thisobject = _.where(businesses, {name: "Microsoft"});


Return all the businesses that are located in Bellevue in a new array.

var bell = _.where(businesses, {city: "Bellevue"});


Sort the businesses based on the city in ascending order and return the array.

var sorted = _.sortBy(businesses, 'city');

Have all the business names be “Coding Dojo” without altering the original array. [hint: use _.map()]

_.map(businesses, function(t)_.where{name: 'Coding Dojo'; });
