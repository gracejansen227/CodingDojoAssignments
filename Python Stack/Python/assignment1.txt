pip install Django==1.11.9

when we run this a second time - the console tells us that the requirement is already satisfied in the certain path
  it says we have already satisfied the python27/ lib site packages in django

pip freeze
  this call outputs the installed packages in requirements format . pip list lists everything while pip freeze isntalls everything installed by pip

  pip list includes editables -- pip freeze does not

  When I ran pip freeze > requirements.txt from my desktop nothing happened nor when I did ls

  pip uninstall Django - uninstalls all the parts of the django package
  and asks us to proceed with a y or n prompt
