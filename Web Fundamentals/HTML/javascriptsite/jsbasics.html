           <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
          <p>
             Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for variety of reasons. It is a small
             and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblity for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside
             a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control
             over them.
           </p>

           <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Declaration</a>

                JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup
                holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                unique names are called identifiers. <span> var x; </span>

            </li>
            <li> <a href="https://www.google.com">Variable Assignment</a>

                Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
                giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span> var x =10 </span>

            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Data Types</a>

                Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span> true </span> or <span> false;</span> null - <span> null </span>
                aka nothing; Number - <span> 42 </span> or <span> 3.14159;</span> String - <span> "Coding Dojo Rocks"; </span>
                Array - <span> [1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo']; </span> and Object - <span> {first_name: 'Jane',last_name:'Doe'} </span>

            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Conditionals</a>

                When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                conditional statements: <span>if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if </span>
                to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span> else </span> we execute this block of code;

             </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Loops</a>

                There are many different freaking kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing:
                they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
                stop. That's a loop!

             </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com">Function</a>

                Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our fucntion this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
                As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
                first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! we finiedh our instructions.
                Sadly HAAA there are a tone more tables to do so lets call our function voer and over and over again till we die.

             </li>
